Hi, I'm **Komla** — a Software Engineer based in the Seattle area, currently working at **Microsoft Azure** where I build and maintain distributed control plane services that power large-scale monitoring infrastructure.

I've spent the last 4+ years working on backend systems: designing APIs, optimizing high-throughput database queries, hardening distributed services, and making sure things don't break in production across multiple cloud regions. I care about reliability, clean architecture, and building tools that make life easier for both customers and teammates.

Before Microsoft, I studied Computer Science (with a minor in Mathematics) at **Michigan State University**, where I was also a recipient of the MasterCard Foundation Scholars Program.

I'm fluent in English and French, and I write code primarily in C#, TypeScript, Python, PowerShell, and SQL.
