Hi, I'm **Your Name** — a software engineer interested in distributed systems, developer tooling, and the craft of building software that lasts.

I currently work at [Company Name](#) as a Senior Software Engineer. Before that I spent several years building and scaling backend infrastructure at [Previous Company](#).

This blog is my attempt to think in public. I write about systems design, engineering career stuff, and occasionally things that are just interesting to me. Posts are infrequent but (I hope) worth reading.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yourusername). The best way to reach me is by email: `you@example.com`.
